# javascript-challenge
The intro to javascript, learning another language and putting it to good use. Apparently, with alien sightings. 
The challenge is to write html code for a website, as well as javascript, that shows a table with different sightings on it, as well as allows the user to interface by narrowing the table down by date, city, country and shape of the sighting.
